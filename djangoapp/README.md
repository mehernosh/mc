# Django

Welcome to the Django backend! 

There's nothing to be done here for the interview set-up, but feel free to look around! ðŸ‘€

For all operations, run them from the project root folder.

## Setup

From the project root run  `script/django/setup`

## Starting the server

From the project root run  `script/django/start`

## Database

- **Database console** `./django/manage.py dbshell`
- **List tables** `.tables`
- **Show table contents** `.dump table_name`

### Adding a column

Migrations in Django rely on inferring differences between your model definitions and table schemas. They donâ€™t work particularly well with SQLite (the default database for this project).

We recommend you nuke and recreate your DB for schema changes:
  `rm django/db.sqlite3 && ./django/manage.py makemigrations && ./django/manage.py migrate`
